### How to use
this is a copy of the wordnet dictionary in a simple api form. You can query this api with the following:


https://wordnet.glitch.me/query?search=**<SEARCH TERM HERE>**
  
So [https://wordnet.glitch.me/query?search=wat](https://wordnet.glitch.me/query?search=wat) will return all words that start with 'wat'
